3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

Here is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:
print("Hello, World!")

Explanation of Basic Syntax Elements
Function Call:

print(): This is a built-in function in Python used to output text to the console. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. In this case, the task is to print the given string to the console.
String:

"Hello, World!": This is a string literal, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. Strings can also be enclosed in single quotes ('Hello, World!'), and both are used to represent text data in Python.
Parentheses:

(): The parentheses after the print function are used to enclose the arguments that the function takes. In this case, the argument is the string "Hello, World!".
Argument:

The string "Hello, World!" is passed as an argument to the print function. Arguments are values or variables that you provide to a function so it can perform its task.



4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.


Python provides several basic data types that are used to represent various kinds of data. Here is a list of the most common basic data types in Python, along with descriptions and a short script demonstrating how to create and use variables of these types:

Basic Data Types in Python
Integer (int):

Represents whole numbers without a fractional part.
Example: 5, -3, 42
Floating Point (float):

Represents numbers with a decimal point.
Example: 3.14, -0.001, 2.718
String (str):

Represents sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
Example: "Hello, World!", 'Python'
Boolean (bool):

Represents truth values: True or False.
Example: True, False
List (list):

Represents an ordered collection of items, which can be of different data types.
Example: [1, 2.5, 'Python']

# Integer
age = 25
print("Age:", age, "Type:", type(age))

# Floating Point
height = 5.9
print("Height:", height, "Type:", type(height))

# String
name = "Alice"
print("Name:", name, "Type:", type(name))

# Boolean
is_student = True
print("Is student:", is_student, "Type:", type(is_student))

# List
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
print("Colors:", colors, "Type:", type(colors))





5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

Conditional Statements
Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. They are fundamental for controlling the flow of your program. The primary conditional statements are if, elif, and else.

if-else Statement
The if-else statement lets you choose between two or more blocks of code based on a condition. If the condition in the if statement evaluates to True, the corresponding block of code is executed. If the condition is False, the code in the else block is executed.

Syntax:
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is False

Example
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")






6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions in Python
Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to encapsulate code into a single unit, making it more organized, manageable, and reusable. Functions can take inputs, called arguments, and return outputs, which makes them useful for modularizing code and avoiding repetition.

Why Functions Are Useful
Code Reusability:

Functions let you write a piece of code once and reuse it multiple times.
Modularity:

Functions help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.
Maintainability:

Functions make it easier to update and maintain code. Changes to the function need to be made in only one place.
Readability:

Functions improve code readability by giving descriptive names to specific tasks.

Writing a Function
Hereâ€™s a simple Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:

def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    This function takes two numbers and returns their sum.
    """
    return a + b



7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

Differences Between Lists and Dictionaries
Order:

Lists: Ordered collections. Elements are stored in a specific sequence and can be accessed by their index (position).
Dictionaries: Unordered collections (in Python 3.7 and later, they maintain insertion order). Elements are accessed by keys, not by index.
Indexing:

Lists: Access elements using zero-based indices (e.g., list[0]).
Dictionaries: Access elements using keys (e.g., dict['key']).
Mutability:

Lists: Mutable; you can change, add, or remove elements.
Dictionaries: Mutable; you can change, add, or remove key-value pairs.
Data Type of Elements:

Lists: Elements can be of any data type, and the types can be mixed within a list.
Dictionaries: Keys must be immutable types (strings, numbers, tuples), but values can be of any type and can be mixed.
Usage:

Lists: Useful for ordered collections where the position of elements matters, such as a sequence of items.
Dictionaries: Useful for associative arrays where data is stored as key-value pairs, allowing for fast lookups by key.


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

   Exception handling in Python is a mechanism for managing runtime errors, allowing you to handle situations where your code might fail without crashing the program.

   Key Components of Exception Handling
try Block:

Contains the code that might raise an exception. This is the block of code where you anticipate that an error might occur.
except Block:

Contains code that runs if an exception occurs in the try block. You can specify different except blocks to handle different types of exceptions.
finally Block:

Contains code that will always execute regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This is often used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.



9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
Modules and packages are fundamental concepts in Python that help in organizing and structuring code. They enable code reuse and improve the modularity and maintainability of your programs.

Creating a Module:
You can create your own module by saving a Python file with a .py extension. For example, create a file named mymodule.py with the following content:
# mymodule.py

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def add(a, b):
    return a + b





10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.


Reading from and writing to files in Python are fundamental operations for handling data. Python provides several methods to work with files, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files.

Reading from a File
To read from a file, follow these steps:

Open the File: Use the open() function with the file path and mode ('r' for reading).
Read the File: Use methods like .read(), .readline(), or .readlines() to read the contents.
Close the File: Use the .close() method to close the file after reading.
Script to Read from a File and Print the Content:

# File path
file_path = 'example.txt'

try:
    # Open the file in read mode
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the content
        content = file.read()
        # Print the content to the console
        print("File Content:")
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{file_path}' does not exist.")
except IOError:
    print("Error: An I/O error occurred while reading the file.")
